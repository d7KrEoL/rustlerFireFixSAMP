# [SAMP, PC] rustlerFireFixSAMP - LUA
In mobile samp there is a bug. Rustler plane cannot damage players or vehicles if they're using mobile samp client. This script for moonloader [PC] fixes it, so you can now damage all players and vehicles. But be careful, it changes network interaction between client and server. 

> [!CAUTION]
> This script sends BulletSync packets and this is not permitted on some samp servers, so you can get banned for using it! Please contact your server's administration before installing it!
